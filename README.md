# Milestone Data Insight Platform

A command-line tool and Python package to download and load datasets (Huggingface format) from the MDI platform.

## Installation

With pip:

```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/Data-insight-Platform/mdi-cli.git@main
```

With poetry, add it to the `pyproject.toml` file of your project:

```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
...
mdi = { git = "https://github.com/Data-insight-Platform/mdi-cli.git", branch = "main" }
...
```

## Usage
### Command-Line Interface

The `mdi` CLI has two main commands: `login` and `load-dataset`.

#### Login

This is an interactive command that prompts the user for an API key and stores it for the future use:

```bash
mdi login
```

**Note:** for non interactive login and multiple login profiles support check: ```mdi profile --help```

#### Load Dataset

This command downloads a dataset from S3, if it's not already downloaded, and loads it as Huggingface Dataset. It has a `--force` option to force a re-download of the data.

```bash
mdi load-dataset --name mnist
```

To force a re-download of the data, use the --force option:

```bash
mdi load-dataset --name mnist --force
```

### Python Package

You can also use `mdi` as a Python package.

Here's an example of how to download a dataset and load it as Huggingface Dataset:

```python
import mdi

# Download the dataset and load it as Huggingface Dataset
dataset = mdi.load_dataset("mnist")

# Use the dataset for training a model
for images, labels in dataset["train"]:
    # training loop
    pass
```

## Configuration with environment variables

There are a few optional environment variables that can be used for configuration.

| Environment variable | Description                                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MDI_API_KEY          | API key to use instead of reading from the config profile       |
| MDI_API_URL          | API url to use instead of reading from the config profile       |
| MDI_CONFIG_FILE      | The location of the configuration file (`config.ini`)           |
| MDI_CACHE_DIR        | The location of the directory where datasets will be downloaded |


## Installation Development Version

Clone the repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Data-insight-Platform/mdi-cli.git
cd mdi-cli
```

Then, install the package using poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

Activate the virtual env (created by poetry):
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To run the module use:
```bash
python -m mdi
```

To install the module from the local directory with `pipx` use:
```bash
pipx install .
```


## Developments notes

For easier development we have a devcontainers configuration located in `.devcontainer` directory. For better portability of the project, we are targeting an older version of Python (specified in the devcontainer config).
