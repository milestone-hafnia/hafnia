# Hafnia

The `hafnia` python package is a collection of tools to create and run model training recipes on
the [Hafnia Platform](https://hafnia.milestonesys.com/). 

The package includes the following interfaces: 

- `cli`: A Command Line Interface (CLI) to 1) configure/connect to Hafnia's [Training-aaS](https://hafnia.readme.io/docs/training-as-a-service) and 2) create and 
launch recipe scripts.
- `hafnia`: A python package with helper functions to load and interact with sample datasets and an experiment
 tracker (`HafniaLogger`). 


## The Concept: Training as a Service (Training-aaS)
`Training-aaS` is the concept of training models on the Hafnia platform on large 
and *hidden* datasets. Hidden datasets refers to datasets that can be used for 
training, but are not available for download or direct access. 

This is a key feature of the Hafnia platform, as a hidden dataset ensures data 
privacy, and allow models to be trained compliantly and ethically by third parties (you).

The `script2model` approach is a Training-aaS concept, where you package your custom training 
script as a *training recipe* and use the recipe to train models on the hidden datasets.

To support local development of a training recipe, we have introduced a **sample dataset** 
for each dataset available in the Hafnia [data library](https://hafnia.milestonesys.com/training-aas/datasets). The sample dataset is a small 
and anonymized subset of the full dataset and available for download. 

With the sample dataset, you can seamlessly switch between local development and Training-aaS. 
Locally, you can create, validate and debug your training recipe. The recipe is then 
launched with Training-aaS, where the recipe runs on the full dataset and can be scaled to run on
multiple GPUs and instances if needed. 

## Getting started: Configuration
To get started with Hafnia: 

1. Install `hafnia` with your favorite python package manager. With pip do this:

    `pip install hafnia`
1. Sign in to the [Hafnia Platform](https://hafnia.milestonesys.com/). 
1. Create an API KEY for Training aaS. For more instructions, follow this 
[guide](https://hafnia.readme.io/docs/create-an-api-key). 
Copy the key and save it for later use.
1. From terminal, configure your machine to access Hafnia: 

    ```
    # Start configuration with
    hafnia configure

    # You are then prompted: 
    Profile Name [default]:   # Press [Enter] or select an optional name
    Hafnia API Key:  # Pass your HAFNIA API key
    Hafnia Platform URL [https://api.mdi.milestonesys.com]:  # Press [Enter]
    ```
1. Download `mnist` from terminal to verify that your configuration is working.  

    ```bash
    hafnia data download mnist --force
    ```

## Getting started: Loading datasets samples
With Hafnia configured on your local machine, it is now possible to download 
and explore the dataset sample with a python script:

```python
from hafnia.data import load_dataset

dataset_splits = load_dataset("mnist")
print(dataset_splits)
print(dataset_splits["train"])
```
The returned sample dataset is a [hugging face dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) 
and contains train, validation and test splits. 

An important feature of `load_dataset` is that it will return the full dataset 
when loaded on the Hafnia platform. 
This enables seamlessly switching between running/validating a training script 
locally (on the sample dataset) and running full model trainings with Training-aaS (on the full dataset). 
without changing code or configurations for the training script.

Available datasets with corresponding sample datasets can be found in [data library](https://hafnia.milestonesys.com/training-aas/datasets) including metadata and description for each dataset. 


## Getting started: Experiment Tracking with HafniaLogger
The `HafniaLogger` is an important part of the recipe script and enables you to track, log and
reproduce your experiments.

When integrated into your training script, the `HafniaLogger` is responsible for collecting:

- **Trained Model**: The model trained during the experiment
- **Model Checkpoints**: Intermediate model states saved during training
- **Experiment Configurations**: Hyperparameters and other settings used in your experiment
- **Training/Evaluation Metrics**: Performance data such as loss values, accuracy, and custom metrics

### Basic Implementation Example

Here's how to integrate the `HafniaLogger` into your training script:

```python
from hafnia.experiment import HafniaLogger

batch_size = 128
learning_rate = 0.001

# Initialize Hafnia logger
logger = HafniaLogger()

# Log experiment parameters
logger.log_configuration({"batch_size": 128, "learning_rate": 0.001})

# Store checkpoints in this path
ckpt_dir = logger.path_model_checkpoints()

# Store the trained model in this path
model_dir = logger.path_model()

# Log scalar and metric values during training and validation
logger.log_scalar("train/loss", value=0.1, step=100)
logger.log_metric("train/accuracy", value=0.98, step=100)

logger.log_scalar("validation/loss", value=0.1, step=100)
logger.log_metric("validation/accuracy", value=0.95, step=100)
```

Similar to `load_dataset`, the tracker behaves differently when running locally or in the cloud. 
Locally, experiment data is stored in a local folder `.data/experiments/{DATE_TIME}`. 

In the cloud, the experiment data will be available in the Hafnia platform under 
[experiments](https://hafnia.milestonesys.com/training-aas/experiments). 

## Example: Torch Dataloader
Commonly for `torch`-based training scripts, a dataset is used in combination 
with a dataloader that performs data augmentations and batching of the dataset as torch tensors.

To support this, we have provided a torch dataloader example script
[example_torchvision_dataloader.py](./examples/example_torchvision_dataloader.py). 

The script demonstrates how to make a dataloader with data augmentation (`torchvision.transforms.v2`)
and a helper function for visualizing image and labels. 

The dataloader and visualization function supports computer vision tasks 
and datasets available in the data library. 

## Example: Training-aaS
By combining logging and dataset loading, we can now construct our model training recipe. 

To demonstrate this, we have provided a recipe project that serves as a template for creating and structuring training recipes
[recipe-classification](https://github.com/milestone-hafnia/recipe-classification)

The project also contains additional information on how to structure your training recipe, use the `HafniaLogger`, the `load_dataset` function and different approach for launching 
the training recipe on the Hafnia platform.


## Create, Build and Run `recipe.zip` locally
In order to test recipe compatibility with Hafnia cloud use the following command to build and 
start the job locally.

```bash
    # Create 'recipe.zip' from source folder '.'
    hafnia recipe create .
    
    # Build the docker image locally from a 'recipe.zip' file
    hafnia runc build-local recipe.zip

    # Execute the docker image locally with a desired dataset
    hafnia runc launch-local --dataset mnist  "python scripts/train.py"
```
